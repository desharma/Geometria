# Geometria

Geometria is a game that was created for Michael Matea's CMPS 80K
in the 2014 Spring Quarter.
Geometria is a 2D platformer that requires the player to manipulate
certain objects in every level in a way that allows them to successfully
reach the exit of each level. The player is a 2D protagonist, and is given
the ability to manipulate certain types of blocks, that all of a certain
radius of influence, in order to reach the exit of each level. The game uses
WASD as controls, as well as the mouse and space bar buttons, which provides
them with all the skills they need to successfully manipulate the different
types of objects. They can split certain types of blocks, as well as press
buttons to gain access to blocks that may be out of their reach. The goal
of the game is to reach the exit of every level and progress to the next
one, but are highly encouraged to complete each level in the simplest way
possible using the least amount of moves. The levels get progressively harder,
and as the player gains familiarity with the different mechanics,
they are expected to develop an intuition that allows them to complete the more difficult levels.
If the player violates any rules of nature, such as dropping the block on top of their self,
or moving a block outside of the radius of influence the game automatically restarts. 
If the player runs into trouble and can't complete the level, they can then restart 
the level with a fresh start, although the amount of moves that they have made are still
recorded throughout all of their various attempts. 

This project was the product of a collaboration between
Andrew Playsted and Deepak Sharma.
